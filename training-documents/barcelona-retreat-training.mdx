## üí¨ Objection Handlers

### **Objection 1: "¬£5,000 is too expensive"**

**Handler:**
*"I completely understand that ¬£5,000 is a significant investment. Let me put it in perspective: if this retreat helps you secure just ONE additional investor at ¬£50,000, or helps you spot one deal you would have missed that makes you ¬£20,000 profit, it's paid for itself 4-10x over.*

*More importantly, this isn't just about one deal ‚Äì it's about building a scalable system that works for years to come. The average attendee implements strategies that generate ¬£50,000-100,000+ in additional profit in their first year post-retreat.*

*The real question isn't 'Can I afford this?' but 'Can I afford to stay stuck where I am for another year?'"*

**Alternative Approach:**
*"What's it costing you right now to NOT have clarity, systems, and investor confidence? If you've been spinning your wheels for 6-12 months, the opportunity cost far exceeds ¬£5,000."*

### **Objection 2: "I don't have time for 3 days away"**

**Handler:**
*"I hear you ‚Äì and that's actually exactly WHY you need this retreat. If you don't have 3 days to step back and work ON your business, you're trapped IN your business.*

*These 3 days will save you MONTHS of trial and error. You'll leave with your Perfect Repeatable Week mapped out, systems to delegate tasks, and a 90-day plan that gives you back your time.*

*Think about it this way: Would you rather spend 3 days now to gain 10+ hours back every week for the next year? That's over 500 hours of your life back. The retreat pays for itself in time within 6 weeks."*

### **Objection 3: "I need to think about it / speak to my partner"**

**Handler:**
*"Absolutely ‚Äì this is an important decision and I'd never want you to rush into it.*

*Here's what I suggest: have that conversation with your partner tonight. Ask yourself these questions together:*
- *Are we happy with where our property business is right now?*
- *If nothing changes, where will we be in 12 months?*
- *What would it mean for our family if we had a clear 90-day plan and working systems?*
- *Is the investment of ¬£5,000 and 3 days worth getting 2-3 years ahead in our business?*

*We only have 10-15 seats and [X] are already taken. I'd hate for you to decide you want in and the retreat is full. Should I hold a provisional spot for 48 hours while you make your decision?"*

### **Objection 4: "I'm not ready yet / I need to do more deals first"**

**Handler:**
*"I appreciate your honesty, and here's the thing ‚Äì the retreat is actually MOST valuable for people who are where you are right now.*

*If you wait until you're 'more experienced,' you'll have built bad habits and inefficient systems that are harder to fix. The best time to build proper foundations is NOW, before you scale.*

*This retreat isn't about doing more deals ‚Äì it's about doing deals BETTER and building a proper business around them. Whether you've done 0 deals, 2 deals, or 10 deals, you need the same foundations: strategy, systems, and investor positioning.*

*The question is: do you want to figure this out through expensive trial and error over the next 2 years, or get it right now?"*

### **Objection 5: "I can learn this from books/YouTube/cheaper courses"**

**Handler:**
*"You're absolutely right that there's tons of free information out there ‚Äì and that might actually be part of the problem. Information overload without implementation leads to analysis paralysis.*

*This retreat isn't about giving you MORE information. It's about giving you:*

1. *A personalised plan specific to YOUR situation*
2. *Direct access to someone who's actually built this business (not just teaching theory)*
3. *Peer accountability with 10-15 other investors at your level*
4. *3 days of focused implementation time away from distractions*
5. *The kick in the pants you need to actually DO IT*

*Free content is general. This is specific, personalised, and implementation-focused. There's a reason the small group size is limited to 10-15 people ‚Äì you're getting coaching, not just content."*

### **Objection 6: "Barcelona is too far to travel"**

**Handler:**
*"I get it ‚Äì international travel adds complexity. But here's why Barcelona was chosen:*

**1. REMOVES YOU FROM DAILY DISTRACTIONS**
*You can't build your strategy while checking emails and handling tenant calls. Being away means you're 100% focused.*

**2. MEMORABLE ENVIRONMENT = BETTER RETENTION**
*Studies show we remember and implement more when learning is tied to unique experiences. You'll remember these 3 days.*

**3. STRATEGIC DECOMPRESSION**
*The Thursday dinner overlooking the Med, optional paddleboarding ‚Äì these aren't just fun, they're where breakthroughs happen in conversation.*

**4. EASY TO REACH**
*Barcelona is a major European hub with direct flights from most UK cities (2-2.5 hours). Compare that to driving 4 hours to a UK venue.*

*Plus, you can extend it into a mini-break if you want ‚Äì implement your 90-day plan while enjoying a few extra days in one of Europe's best cities."*

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary className="cursor-pointer text-lg font-semibold mb-4">About the Retreat</summary>

**Q: How many people will be in the group?**
A: Maximum 10-15 delegates. This intimate size ensures everyone gets personalised attention from Susannah and time for one-on-one strategy work.

**Q: Who leads the retreat?**
A: Susannah leads all three days, with specialist sessions from Zac on AI & Automation tools. You'll get direct access to someone who's built and runs a successful property portfolio business.

**Q: Is this retreat suitable for beginners?**
A: This retreat is best for people who have some property knowledge or have done a few deals, but are stuck on strategy, systems, or scaling. Complete beginners may find the pace too advanced. The discovery call will help determine fit.

**Q: What property strategies are covered?**
A: Deal Packaging, Flipping (3 types), BRRR/Portfolio Building, Commercial to Residential Conversions, Assisted Sales, and Delayed Completion. You'll define which strategy is right for YOUR goals.

**Q: Will I have to present or speak in front of the group?**
A: Yes, but in a supportive way. Everyone does a brief introduction (2-3 mins) on Day 1, and on Day 3 you'll present your 90-day plan to the group for feedback. This accountability and peer insight is part of what makes the retreat so powerful.

</details>

<details>

</details>

<details>
<summary className="cursor-pointer text-lg font-semibold mb-4">Business & Implementation</summary>

**Q: Will I get ongoing support after the retreat?**
A: The retreat provides Business-in-a-Box resources, templates, and frameworks you can use independently. You'll also connect with the other delegates for peer accountability. Additional ongoing coaching or mentorship would be separate from the retreat.

**Q: What if I don't have any deals yet?**
A: That's okay if you have property knowledge and are committed to doing deals. The retreat will help you define your strategy and build your deal flow pipeline. However, if you're a complete novice, the discovery call will assess if it's the right time for you.

**Q: Can I bring a business partner?**
A: Yes! Business partners can both attend. There's a "Booked Retreat Partner Booking" tag in our system. Each person pays ¬£5,000 (total ¬£10,000 for two seats).

**Q: What if I can't make all three days?**
A: The retreat is designed as a complete 3-day journey. Missing even one day means you'll miss critical content and won't get the full transformation. We can't offer partial attendance or refunds for missed days.

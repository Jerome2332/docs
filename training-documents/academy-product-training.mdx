## ‚ùì Handling Product Questions

### **Common Questions About Deal Packaging Academy**

#### **Q: "I don't have any property experience - can I really do this?"**
**A:** *"Absolutely! The academy is designed specifically for complete beginners. You'll learn everything from scratch through 230+ lessons, and many of our students had zero property experience when they started. The beauty of deal packaging is you're connecting people with opportunities - you don't need to be a property expert yourself, just skilled at finding and analyzing deals."*

#### **Q: "How do I get paid if I'm not buying the properties?"**
**A:** *"You earn a finder's fee or commission for bringing the deal to investors. Typically this is ¬£15,000 per deal on a ¬£300k property. You're essentially a deal finder or sourcing agent - investors pay you for finding them profitable opportunities. It's a legitimate, established business model in the property industry."*

#### **Q: "What if I can't find any investors?"**
**A:** *"That's exactly what the Investor Attraction Masterclass teaches you. You'll learn specific strategies to identify, attract, and build relationships with cash-rich investors, even as a complete beginner. Plus, our community of 700+ members includes investors looking for deals, so you'll have networking opportunities built in."*

#### **Q: "How long until I earn my first commission?"**
**A:** *"Many of our students earn their first fees within 30 days. Obviously results vary based on effort and market conditions, but the business model is designed for relatively quick returns compared to other property strategies. Your first deal can completely pay for your academy investment and then some."*

### **Common Questions About Flipping Property Academy**

#### **Q: "I don't have ¬£100k to flip properties - can I still do this?"**
**A:** *"Yes! The academy includes comprehensive Joint Venture training that teaches you how to partner with investors who provide the capital. You find the deal, manage the project, and split the profits 50/50. Many successful flippers started this way with no capital of their own. You can also start with smaller projects requiring less capital."*

#### **Q: "I've never renovated anything - is this too advanced?"**
**A:** *"Not at all! The academy includes 217+ lessons covering everything from absolute basics to advanced strategies. You'll learn how to find and manage reliable contractors, so you don't have to do the physical work yourself. Many successful flippers have never picked up a hammer - they're project managers who coordinate skilled tradespeople."*

#### **Q: "How long does a flip take from start to finish?"**
**A:** *"A typical flip takes 6-9 months from purchase to sale. This includes 1-2 months finding the deal, 3-4 months for renovation, and 1-2 months to sell. Obviously this varies by project size and complexity, but that's a realistic timeline for your first flip. The academy teaches you how to manage timelines effectively."*

#### **Q: "What if I can't sell the property?"**
**A:** *"The academy teaches you proper deal analysis from the start, so you're buying properties with built-in profit and demand. You'll learn to identify areas with strong buyer demand and how to renovate to appeal to local buyers. Plus, the live coaching calls let you get feedback on potential deals before you commit. The key is proper due diligence, which we teach comprehensively."*

## ü§î Handling "Which Academy?" Questions

### **When Prospects Ask: "Which one should I choose?"**

#### **Discovery Questions to Ask:**
1. *"How much capital do you currently have available to invest in property?"*
2. *"How quickly are you looking to see returns - within months or within a year?"*
3. *"Do you prefer finding and analyzing deals, or managing hands-on projects?"*
4. *"What's your risk tolerance - very cautious or comfortable with calculated risks?"*
5. *"How much time can you commit per week right now?"*

#### **Decision Matrix**

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Choose Deal Packaging If:" icon="package">
    - Little to no capital available (under ¬£20k)
    - Wants faster results (30-day timeline)
    - Prefers networking and deal-finding
    - Very risk-averse
    - Limited time (10-15 hours/week)
    - Wants to keep current job
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Choose Flipping If:" icon="home">
    - Has significant capital (¬£50k+) or JV contacts
    - Can wait 6-12 months for returns
    - Enjoys project management
    - Comfortable with moderate risk
    - Can commit 20-30 hours/week
    - Wants larger profits per transaction
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

#### **Choose BOTH If:**
- Has capital but wants multiple income streams
- Wants to package deals while own flips are ongoing
- Serious about building full-time property business
- Can commit to comprehensive property education

---

## üìà Selling Multiple Academies

### **When to Recommend Both Academies**

#### **Ideal Scenarios:**
- Prospect has significant capital AND time
- Wants comprehensive property education
- Planning to make property their career
- Sees value in multiple income streams
- Highly motivated and committed

#### **Bundle Positioning:**
*"Many of our most successful students actually do both. They use deal packaging to generate quick income and build their investor network, then use those relationships and income to fund their own flips. It's a powerful combination - the packaging generates cash flow while you're waiting for flip projects to complete, and your flipping experience makes you better at identifying good packaging deals."*

#### **Pricing Consideration:**
- Both academies at ¬£197/month each = ¬£394/month total
- OR ¬£4,728/year if paid annually (saves ¬£800)
- Position as investment in comprehensive property business education

<Note>
  **Zac Discount:** Second academy half price for existing students

### **Template 2: Discovery to Recommendation (Flipping)**

**Prospect:** *"I've done some DIY on my own home and really enjoyed it. I like the idea of transforming properties."*

**Rep:** *"Excellent. And in terms of timeline, are you looking for quick returns within a few months, or are you comfortable with a 6-12 month investment timeline for potentially larger returns?"*

**Prospect:** *"I can definitely wait 6-12 months if the returns are worth it."*

**Rep:** *"Perfect. Based on your capital available, your interest in the hands-on side of property, and your timeline, I'd strongly recommend our Flipping Property Academy. Let me explain why this is ideal for your situation..."*

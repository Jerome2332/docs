## ⚖️ Comparing Mentoring to Academies

### **When to Recommend Mentoring vs Academies**

| Feature | Academies | 1-to-1 Mentoring |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Price** | £197/month + VAT (£236.40) or £1970 + VAT = £2,364/year | £4,166.67 + VAT = £5,000 (6 months) |
| **Format** | Self-paced video lessons | Live 1-to-1 sessions |
| **Personalization** | Generic for all students | Completely customized |
| **Support** | Community + group calls | Direct access to Susannah |
| **Deal Review** | General guidance on calls | Specific review of YOUR deals |
| **Systems Access** | Templates included | Complete 'Business in a Box' |
| **Duration** | 12 months minimum | 6 months focused program |
| **Best For** | Learning fundamentals | Implementing with expert guidance |
| **Accountability** | Self-driven + community | Direct accountability to mentor |
| **Speed to Results** | Self-paced learning | Accelerated with guidance |

### **The Investment Comparison**

#### **Academy Annual Investment:**
- £2,364 per year (one academy)
- £4,728 per year (both academies)
- Generic content for all students
- Limited personalized support

#### **Mentoring Investment:**
- £5,000 inc VAT (£4,166.67 + VAT) for 6 months
- Completely personalized to you
- Direct access to 18+ years expertise
- Implementation support on actual deals
- 'Business in a Box' systems

<Tip>
  **Value Perspective:** "While the mentoring investment is higher upfront, many students find it actually saves them money by helping them avoid costly mistakes on their first deal. One avoided mistake or one optimized deal can easily pay for the entire mentoring investment. Plus, you're compressing years of trial and error into 6 months of focused guidance."

## 💬 Handling Mentoring Objections

### **Price Objections for Mentoring**

#### **"£5,000 is a lot of money for mentoring"**

**Response Framework:**
*"I completely understand - it is a significant investment. Let me put it in perspective. If you're about to invest £100,000 in a property, would you rather have expert guidance to help you choose the right one and avoid mistakes, or go it alone and risk a costly error?*

*One wrong property decision could cost you £20,000, £30,000, or more. The mentoring is essentially insurance and acceleration - Susannah's guidance helps you avoid those expensive mistakes while finding better opportunities. Many mentees find the investment pays for itself through just one optimized deal or one avoided mistake.*

*Plus, you're getting the complete 'Business in a Box' systems that Susannah used to source £45 million in deals. These proven systems alone would take years to develop on your own."*

**Alternative Approach:**
*"I hear you on the investment level. Let me ask - how much capital are you planning to invest in property over the next 6-12 months?"*

**[If they say £50k+]**
*"So you're comfortable investing £50,000+ in property, but hesitant about £5,000 to ensure you invest that £50,000 wisely? Think of the mentoring as 10% of your first investment - but it protects all your future investments too. Which is riskier - investing £50,000 without expert guidance, or investing £55,000 total with an experienced advisor reviewing every decision?"*

#### **"Can I just do the academy first?"**

**Response Framework:**
*"That's definitely an option, and many people do start with the academy. Let me help you think through which path makes more sense for your specific situation.*

*The academy is excellent for learning fundamentals and works well if you're not ready to invest capital yet or prefer self-paced learning. However, the mentoring is designed for people who are ready to implement and want to compress their timeline significantly.*

*Tell me - do you currently have capital available to invest in property? And are you looking to get your first deal done within the next 6 months?"*

**[If yes to both]**
*"Then honestly, mentoring is probably the better investment. Here's why: with the academy, you'll spend 6-12 months learning, then start implementing. With mentoring, you're learning AND implementing simultaneously with expert guidance. You could potentially complete your first profitable deal during the 6-month mentoring program, making the investment pay for itself.*

*Plus, mistakes on your first deal could cost far more than the difference between academy and mentoring. Many of our mentoring students previously took courses elsewhere and wish they'd had expert guidance from the start."*

#### **"What if I don't have time for biweekly sessions?"**

**Response Framework:**
*"I appreciate you thinking through the commitment required. The biweekly structure - one hour every two weeks - is actually designed for busy people. That's just 2 hours per month, which is very manageable even with a full-time job.*

*Between sessions, you're implementing what you discussed, finding deals, doing research. Then you come to the next session with specific questions, deals to review, and challenges to solve. It's actually quite efficient.*

*However, if you truly can't commit to one hour every two weeks for 6 months, then you're probably not ready to actively invest in property yet - because finding, analyzing, and completing property deals requires significantly more time than that. Would you agree?"*

#### **"How do I know mentoring is worth it?"**

**Response Framework:**
*"That's exactly the right question to ask. Let me share some specific ways mentoring delivers value:*

**Mistake Prevention:** *One of our mentees was about to buy a property that looked great on paper. During their session, Susannah identified a major issue with the local market that would have cost them £25,000+ in losses. That one conversation paid for their entire mentoring program.*

**Deal Optimization:** *Another mentee found a flip opportunity they thought would make £30k profit. After reviewing with Susannah and adjusting the strategy, they made £52k instead - an extra £22k from expert guidance.*

**Faster Results:** *The average time for academy students to complete their first deal is 2-3 months. Mentoring students often get deals within the first month because they're implementing with expert guidance from day one.*

**Systems That Work:** *You get immediate access to the exact systems Susannah used to source £45 million in deals. These aren't theoretical - they're battle-tested systems from actual deals.*

*Would you rather spend 6 months with expert guidance, or 18 months figuring it out yourself through trial and error?"*

## 💼 Sales Conversation Templates

### **Template 1: Academy Student Upgrading to Mentoring**

**Rep:** *"I can see you've been making good progress with the academy. What's prompting your interest in the mentoring program now?"*

**Student:** *"I've learned a lot from the academy, but I'm struggling to actually implement what I've learned. I keep second-guessing myself and I've found a potential deal but I'm not confident about it."*

**Rep:** *"That's exactly the situation mentoring is designed for. You've got the foundational knowledge from the academy, but now you need implementation support and confidence on real deals. The mentoring program would give you direct access to Susannah to review that specific deal you mentioned, plus guide you through the entire implementation process.*

*Tell me about the deal you're considering - how much are you looking to invest?"*

**Student:** *"It's a potential flip, around £120k purchase with maybe £30k renovation. But I'm just not sure if the numbers work."*

**Rep:** *"Perfect. So you're about to invest £150k, but you're uncertain about the analysis. This is exactly where mentoring adds massive value. For a £5,000 investment, you'd get Susannah's expert review of this deal specifically, plus guidance on 11 more sessions over 6 months as you implement.*

*If she helps you avoid one mistake or optimize this deal by just £5,000, the mentoring has already paid for itself. Plus, you'll have her support for your next deals too. Does getting expert review on a £150k investment make sense?"*

### **Template 2: High-Net-Worth Prospect (No Previous Academy)**

**Rep:** *"Tell me about your property investment experience so far."*

**Prospect:** *"I'm new to property investment but I have around £200k I'm looking to invest. I've been researching for months but honestly feel overwhelmed by all the different strategies and conflicting advice online."*

**Rep:** *"I completely understand - there's so much information out there that it's hard to know what's right for your specific situation. With £200k to invest, you need a clear strategy tailored to your circumstances, not generic advice.*

*This is where our 1-to-1 mentoring program really shines. Rather than spending more months researching and potentially making expensive mistakes, you'd work directly with Susannah Cole who has 18+ years experience and has sourced £45 million in property deals.*

*She would analyze your specific situation - your £200k capital, your goals, your risk tolerance, your time availability - and create a personalized strategy just for you. Then guide you through implementing it over 6 months with 12 one-on-one sessions.*

*Think of it this way: you're about to invest £200,000. Would you rather do that with or without expert guidance from someone who's successfully done this for nearly two decades?"*

**Prospect:** *"That makes sense. What's involved in the mentoring?"*

**Rep:** *"The investment is £5,000 for the 6-month program - essentially 2.5% of your planned investment to ensure you invest that £200k wisely. You get 12 personal one-hour sessions with Susannah delivered biweekly, plus you can email her between sessions for urgent questions or deal reviews.*

*You also get complete access to her 'Business in a Box' systems - these are the actual systems she used to source those millions in deals. Not templates, but proven systems from her active business.*

*Many mentoring clients complete their first deal during the 6-month program, so you could potentially be earning returns while still being mentored. Given you have £200k ready to invest, does it make sense to start with expert guidance rather than trial and error?"*

### **Template 3: Experienced Investor Wanting to Scale**

**Rep:** *"You mentioned you already have a few properties. What are you looking to achieve with mentoring?"*

**Prospect:** *"I have 3 buy-to-let properties that are doing okay, but I want to scale faster. I feel like I'm missing opportunities or not optimizing my current approach."*

**Rep:** *"That's a perfect use case for mentoring. You're past the beginner stage but need expert perspective to reach the next level. What's your current property portfolio worth?"*

**Prospect:** *"Around £600k total value, probably £200k in equity."*

**Rep:** *"So you've proven you can invest successfully, but you want to accelerate and optimize. This is exactly where Susannah's experience becomes invaluable. She's not just going to teach you concepts - she's going to review your existing portfolio, identify optimization opportunities, and help you develop a scaling strategy.*

*With £200k in equity and existing properties, you're sitting on significant potential. The mentoring program would help you unlock that potential through her 18+ years of experience across multiple strategies - flipping, sourcing, deal packaging, finance raising.*

*The investment is £5,000 for 6 months of personalized guidance. Given your portfolio value and growth goals, does getting expert input on your scaling strategy make sense?"*

## 🔄 Positioning Mentoring with Academies

### **The Academy + Mentoring Combination**

**When It Works:** Some prospects want both comprehensive knowledge AND personalized implementation support.

**Positioning:** *"Many serious students actually combine the academy with mentoring for maximum results. The academy gives you comprehensive knowledge across all strategies, while the mentoring provides personalized implementation support.*

*Think of it like this: the academy is your complete education, teaching you everything. The mentoring is your personal coach helping you apply that education to your specific situation and holding you accountable for taking action.*

*The combined investment over 12 months would be:*
- *Academy: £2,364/year*
- *Mentoring: £5,000 (6 months)*
- *Total: £7,364 for complete education AND implementation support*

*For someone serious about building a property business, this combination accelerates results significantly."*

### **The Upgrade Path**

**Common Path:**
- **Months 1-3:** Start with academy, learn fundamentals
- **Months 4-6:** Continue academy, identify strategy that fits
- **Months 7-12:** Add mentoring for implementation support

**Positioning:** *"Many students start with the academy to build foundational knowledge, then upgrade to mentoring when they're ready to implement. This can work well if you're not ready to invest capital immediately.*

*However, if you already have capital available and want results sooner, starting with mentoring alongside the academy can compress your timeline significantly. You're learning from the academy while getting personalized implementation guidance from Susannah."*

# Call Handling Procedures

This document outlines the standard procedures for managing discovery calls, bookings, and client interactions in Keap (Infusionsoft), Calendly, and Go High Level.

## Lead Management

### Using the Call Closer Spreadsheet

1. Access the TGPC - Closer Calls 2025 Spreadsheet
2. Open the Lead List: Locate and open the sheet labeled with the correct month (e.g., "March & April 2025")
3. Call Assigned Leads: Begin calling the leads listed in your assigned sheet
4. Update the DC Next Step Column and DC Admin Next Step Column with the correct status
5. Update the Hot List/Call Out List to indicate follow-up actions, including all relevant notes
6. Save updates in Keap using the note template "Next Steps" and add the notes as the description
7. Repeat steps 4-6 for every discovery call completed
8. Update the Outcome Column to indicate the result of the final discovery call

## Discovery Call Procedures

### Booking a Discovery Call

1. Log in to Calendly and select the correct user
2. Select and open the correct event type
3. Enter the correct information in the necessary fields
4. Click Schedule Event to confirm the meeting

After booking the call in Calendly:

1. Log in to Infusionsoft/Keap using your `@thegoodpropertycompany.co.uk` account
2. Search for the lead in Keap by their name or email address
3. Add a note and select the appropriate Discovery Call template, such as:
   - Booked 1st Discovery Call → Warm Up Pre Call
   - Booked 2nd Discovery Call → Warm Up Pre Call
   - etc.
4. Add the correct call description in this format: `[CALL SETTER'S NAME] / [MONTH] / [DATE] / [TIME]`
   - Example: `ZAC MARCH 7TH 1PM`
5. Click Save to confirm the update in Keap
6. Record the booking in both the Call Setter spreadsheet and Call Closer spreadsheet

### Discovery Call Counting Rules

Discovery Calls count cumulatively regardless of who delivered them. For example:
- 1st Discovery Call with Zac
- 2nd with Susannah
- 3rd with Zac

These are all counted in sequence as their 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Discovery Calls.

**Important**: If a Discovery Call was previously booked but the client did not attend (no-show, cancelled, or rescheduled), that call does not count toward the next number. The count only increases once the Discovery Call has actually been delivered.

### Handling Late Attendees

If a lead is late joining the call:

1. Copy the Zoom link of the meeting
2. Log in to Go High Level and find the lead
3. Using GHL, send them these text message and email:

**Text Message:**
```
Hi [Lead Name], I am in our Zoom link now for our property meeting. Here is the link: [Insert Link]. I will wait 10 minutes before jumping out. I hope you can join me, see you soon, [Caller Name]
```

**Email:**
```
Subject: Property Meeting – Join Me on Zoom

Hi [Lead Name],

I'm in our Zoom meeting now. You can join using this link: [Insert Link].

I'll wait for 10 minutes before heading out. Hope to see you there!

Best,
[Caller Name]
```

After 10 minutes, send an additional message: "I'm jumping out of the meeting...here's the link to rebook..."
